Docker compose
=============================
Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and manage multi-container Docker applications. 
Instead of running individual docker run commands for each container,
you can use a single docker-compose.yml file to define and run all the services together.
###############Key Features of Docker Compose
Multi-container application management: You can define and run multiple containers at once.
Declarative configuration: Uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to define services, networks, and volumes.
Simplifies container orchestration: With a single command, you can start (docker-compose up) or stop (docker-compose down) all services.
Service dependencies: Automatically manages dependencies between containers

or:
compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications 
With compose, you use a Compose file to configure your applications's services. 
Then , using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration


Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of yur applications;
1. start , stop and rebuild serivces
2. Viw the status of running services
3. Stream the log output of running services
4. Run a one-off command on a service.

# docker compose uses a configuration file, where you define all the different stuffs we perform on command line into a file
 1. The file is basically an Yaml file(.yml)
2. Default file is docker-compose.yml

#################Compose File template: Dcokerfile#######################################
version:"compose version"
services:
  <ServiceName>
        <attribute1>:value
        <attribute1>:value



step 1: $ apt install -y docker-compose
step2: 
ubuntu@localhost:~$ vi docker-compose.yml
ubuntu@localhost:~$ cat docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  accha:  (image name)
    build:  .  (same directory)
    container_name: mau1  
  accha2:
    build: .
    container_name: mau2
###NOte services doesn't take name in uppercase so make sure to use it in lowrcase



ubuntu@localhost:~$ ls
Dockerfile  Notes-app  docker-compos.yml  docker-compose.yml  myfile  web  website

#to run the command
$docker-compose up -d

#create and start containers(defaults to interactive mode)
$docker-compose up

#create and start sepcific services and its containers
$docker-compose up -d <servicename>

#list contianers
$dockr-compose ps <service>

stop and remove contianers 
#docker-compose down<service>
